# "En/De-CODE IT"    [ChromeSecurityExtension]

***Chrome Extension for data encryption using AES Algorithm***

- Chrome extension which can be used to stop social engineering attack & store data like email in encrypted form.
- Used 256 bits key (**expressed as a hexadecimal string with 64 characters.**) which results in	1.1 x 10^77.
- AES is symmatric key encryption method.
- As the number of bit it high it is more secure than DES(56), RSA(112) or AES(128). This algorithm is virtually(Arithmatically caluation based) impossible to break.
- However, this security comes with time complexity for encryption and decryption.

***To Use this extension:***

- Download the zip of this [repo](https://github.com/KishanMistri/En-De-CODE-IT/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
- Locate the ZIP file on your computer and unzip it.
- Go to the (chrome://extensions/) page on your CHROME browser 
- Click the Load unpacked extension button and select the unzipped folder for your extension to install it.
- You are ready to go...!

*Facts:*

- With the right quantum computer, AES-128 would take about 2.61*10^12 years to crack, while AES-256 would take 2.29 x 10^32 years.
- For Asymmatric kind of algorithms can be cracked with right Quantum computer but not this level of strength of AES is crackable.

***Note: I highly recommend you to feel free to go through sourcecode to ensure your security before using any custom extension as they have powerful capabilities of reading cookies and history from your browser***
