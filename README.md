# "En/De-CODE IT"    [ChromeSecurityExtension]

***Chrome Extension for data encryption using AES Algorithm***

- Chrome extension which can be used to stop social engineering attack & store data like email in encrypted form.
- Used 256 bits key (**expressed as a hexadecimal string with 64 characters.**) which results in	1.1 x 10^77.
- AES is symmatric key encryption method.
- As the number of bit it high it is more secure than DES(56), RSA(112) or AES(128). This algorithm is virtually(Arithmatically caluation based) impossible to break.
- However, this security comes with time complexity for encryption and decryption.

*Facts:*

- With the right quantum computer, AES-128 would take about 2.61*10^12 years to crack, while AES-256 would take 2.29 x 10^32 years.
- For Asymmatric kind of algorithms can be cracked with right Quantum computer but not this level of strength of AES is crackable.
